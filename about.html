                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p> Allow me to introduce myself, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    if you haven't figured it out already, the name is Flip. I was born on the 15th of July in the year 2015. I personally like to keep myself busy, I am well acquainted in multiple disciplines, such as chilling. 
                    <br>
                    Chilling is not just a pastime; it's an art, and I've mastered it to purr-fection. Whether it's a sunny spot by the window, a cozy corner of the couch, or a strategically placed cardboard box. I know how to make the most of relaxation and I have a knack for finding the warmest spots in the house, claiming them as my own. In my downtime, you'll catch me grooming my luxurious coat, practicing the elusive catnap, and occasionally engaging in deep contemplation about the mysteries of the universe. 
                    <br>
                    The one other important thing is eating, I take great pride in my refined palate. You can often find me indulging in the finest feline cuisine. From gourmet wet food to the crunchiest kibbles. That being said, I also like to hunt. You should know that I am also a refined hunter and will occasionally bring a mouse home. 
                    <br>
                    I believe that's enough information. 
                    <br>
                    You can take some well deserved rest now. 
                    <br>
